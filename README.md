Project to create a blackjack game using JavaScript.

To make the project seem realistic, there is a limited number of cards in one full deck of playing cards. 
The game will be singleplayer, the player will be playing vs a machine. Like in blackjack the player will start the 
game by choosing to pass, take a card or enough. Afterwards the Bot will automatically make his turn and take decisons 
depending on the rules like in a Cassino. At last the game will check if the player won or lose.
